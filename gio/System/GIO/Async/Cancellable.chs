-- | Creates a new 'Cancellable' object.
-- 
-- Applications that want to start one or more operations that should be cancellable should create a

-- 
-- One 'Cancellable' can be used in multiple consecutive operations, but not in multiple concurrent
-- operations.

-- | Checks if a cancellable job has been cancelled.
cancellableIsCancelled :: Cancellable 
 -> IO Bool -- ^ returns 'True' if cancellable is cancelled, 'False' if called with 'Nothing' or if item is not cancelled.
cancellableIsCancelled =
    liftM toBool . {# call cancellable_is_cancelled #}

-- | If the cancellable is cancelled, sets the error to notify that the operation was cancelled.
cancellableThrowErrorIfCancelled :: Cancellable

  IO (Maybe Cancellable)  -- ^ returns a 'Cancellable' from the top of the stack, or 'Nothing' if the stack is empty.
cancellableGetCurrent =
    maybeNull (constructNewGObject mkCancellable) $
    {# call cancellable_get_current #} 

-- | Pops cancellable off the cancellable stack (verifying that cancellable is on the top of the stack).
cancellablePopCurrent :: Maybe Cancellable -> IO ()
cancellablePopCurrent cancellable =
    maybeWith withGObject cancellable g_cancellable_pop_current
    where
      _ = {# call cancellable_pop_current #}

-- | Pushes cancellable onto the cancellable stack. The current cancllable can then be recieved using
-- 'cancellableGetCurrent' .
-- 
-- This is useful when implementing cancellable operations in code that does not allow you to pass down
-- the cancellable object.
-- 
-- This is typically called automatically by e.g. 'File' operations, so you rarely have to call this
-- yourself.

cancellablePushCurrent cancellable =

-- | Resets cancellable to its uncancelled state.
cancellableReset :: Cancellable -> IO ()
cancellableReset = {# call cancellable_reset #}

-- | Will set cancellable to cancelled, and will emit the "cancelled" signal. (However, see the warning
-- about race conditions in the documentation for that signal if you are planning to connect to it.)
-- 
-- This function is thread-safe. In other words, you can safely call it from a thread other than the
-- one running the operation that was passed the cancellable.
-- 
-- The convention within gio is that cancelling an asynchronous operation causes it to complete
-- asynchronously. That is, if you cancel the operation from the same thread in which it is running,
-- then the operation's 'AsyncReadyCallback' will not be invoked until the application returns to the
-- main loop.
cancellableCancel :: Cancellable -> IO ()
cancellableCancel = {# call cancellable_cancel #}

-- | Emitted when the operation has been cancelled.
-- 
-- Can be used by implementations of cancellable operations. If the operation is cancelled from another
-- thread, the signal will be emitted in the thread that cancelled the operation, not the thread that
-- is running the operation.
-- 
-- Note that disconnecting from this signal (or any signal) in a multi-threaded program is prone to
-- race conditions. For instance it is possible that a signal handler may be invoked even after a call
-- to 'signalHandlerDisconnect' for that handler has already returned.
-- 
-- There is also a problem when cancellation happen right before connecting to the signal. If this
-- happens the signal will unexpectedly not be emitted, and checking before connecting to the signal
-- leaves a race condition where this is still happening.
cancellableCancelled :: Signal Cancellable (IO ())
