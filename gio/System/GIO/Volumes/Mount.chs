module System.GIO.Volumes.Mount (
-- * Details
--
-- | The 'Mount' interface represents user-visible mounts. Note, when porting from GnomeVFS, 'Mount' is the
-- moral equivalent of GnomeVFSVolume.
-- 
-- 'Mount' is a "mounted" filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in quotes because it's not the same
-- as a unix mount, it might be a gvfs mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use
-- GIO. Might or might not be related to a volume object.
-- 
-- Unmounting a 'Mount' instance is an asynchronous operation. For more information about asynchronous
-- operations, see 'AsyncReady' and GSimpleAsyncReady. To unmount a 'Mount' instance, first call
-- 'mountUnmountWithOperation' the 'Mount' instance and a 'AsyncReadyCallback'. The
-- callback will be fired when the operation has resolved (either with success or failure), and a
-- 'AsyncReady' structure will be passed to the callback. That callback should then call
-- 'mountUnmountWithOperationFinish' with the 'Mount' and the 'AsyncReady' data to see if the
-- operation was completed successfully. If an error is present when
-- 'mountUnmountWithOperationFinish' is called, then it will be filled with any error
-- information.
