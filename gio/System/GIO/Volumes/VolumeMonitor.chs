-- * Details
--
-- | 'VolumeMonitor' is for listing the user interesting devices and volumes on the computer. In other
-- words, what a file selector or file manager would show in a sidebar.
-- 
-- 'VolumeMonitor' is not thread-default-context aware, and so should not be used other than from the
-- main thread, with no thread-default-context active.
