Gtk2Hs: A GUI Library for Haskell based on Gtk+

http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/

Gtk2hs is a set of Haskell packages wrapping the GTK GUI stack:

* gtk (GUI toolkit)
* cairo (graphics library)
* svgcairo (Cairo SVG loader)
* pango (text rendering)
* glade (libglade UI loader)
* glib (GLib2 library)
* gio (VFS library)
* gtkglext (Gtk+ OpenGL extension)
* gtksourceview2 (source code editor)
* gconf (GConf2 configuration system)
* gstreamer (media codec library)
* vte (terminal emulator)
* webkit (WebKit rendering engine)

Also gtk2hs-buildtools and the soegtk library are provided.

The following packages are deprecated:
* gnomevfs (replaced by gio)
* mozembed (replaced by webkit)

The GHC Haskell compiler, version 6.10.4 or greater, is required.
Gtk2Hs is known to compile on Linux, Windows, OSX, FreeBSD, and Solaris.

These instruuctions are about building Gtk2Hs from source. If you would rather
install a binary (pre-compiled) package, please check the Gtk2Hs web site:
your distribution may also provide gtk2hs packages.


Building
--------

From version 0.11, gtk2hs is now distributed as separate packages on hackage.
So the easiest way to install it is using "cabal-install", eg
$ cabal install gtk

This section assumes that you are building from a darcs checkout or snapshot.
If you are building on Windows, read "Building on Windows" first.

The following assumes that the sources are in ~/gtk2hs.

Building from darcs
-------------------

Building the latest sources from the darcs repository is normally straight
forward. In fact, since Gtk2Hs is only a wrapper around Gtk+, the development
version is usually not as "unstable" as it is for most software projects.
You must have all the appropriate development packages installed of course
(glib2, pango, gtk2, etc) for all the packages you wish to build.

You can get the latest development darcs source tree by running:

~:$ darcs get --lazy http://code/haskell.org/gtk2hs

The easiest way to build everything is to run the script:

~/gtk2hs:$ sh bootstrap.sh

which build the tools and all the main supported libraries.

Otherwise you can run "cabal install" by hand in a appropriate order
in a desired subset of the individual package directories.


Running the demos.
------------------

To get started, you can compile and run one of the programs that reside in
the demo/ directory in the gtk2hs source directory. For example:

~/gtk2hs/demo/hello:$ make

which has the same effect as typing

~/gtk2hs/demo/hello:$ ghc --make World.hs -o helloworld

The program should pop up a dialog box when you run

~/gtk2hs/demo/hello:$ ./helloworld


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available on the website and in hackage.
You can also build the documentation locally with cabal.


Deinstallation
-----------------
Alteratively, you can uninstall by unregistering the packages with ghc-pkg
and deleting the installed files.  Eg reversing the order in bootstrap.sh:

# for pkg in webkit vte svgcairo soegtk gtksourceview2 gtkglext gstreamer glade gconf gtk pango cairo gio glib gtk2hs-buildtools ; \
> do ghc-pkg unregister $pkg; done


Building on Windows
--------------------

Install MSYS and MinGW. Download a build of Gtk+, you will need the "dev"
version which includes all the header files and libraries. Make sure that GHC
and that pkg-config.exe can find all your Gtk+ libraries. The configure script
should complain if this is not the case.
