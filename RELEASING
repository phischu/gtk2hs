This file is a collection of notes and reminders of things to do around the
time of a release. None of this is by any means set in stone.

Before release:

* Take a look through the bug tracker.
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/gtk2hs
* Test that it builds! This is supposed to be a cross-platform library, too,
  and support for a lot of setups is one of our selling points. There's a lot
  of knobs, each with a lot of settings:
  32-bit or 64-bit architecture
  Windows, Linux, or Mac
  GHC version
  GTK library version
  It's basically impossible to test that it builds on every combination, but a
  representative sampling would be nice.
* Check that the demos still work. There are demo directories in each Hackage
  package's directory.
* Bump all the version numbers in tandem.

At release time:

* Upload all the new packages. Some shell like this seems reasonable:
  for i in tools glib gio cairo pango gtk; do
    pushd $i
    rm dist/*.tar.gz
    cabal sdist && cabal upload dist/*.tar.gz
    popd
  done
* Make an announcement on the mailing lists. Below is a template email. Once in
  a while, you might want to run a command like this to update the
  "contributors" section:
  darcs log | grep '^[^ ]' | cut -b31- | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

  Subject: [ANN] gtk2hs-X.X.X
  Body:

  Today, we welcome into the world version X.X.X of Gtk2Hs[1], a set of Haskell
  bindings to many of the libraries included in the Gtk+/Gnome platform. Gtk+
  is an extensive and mature multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
  interfaces.

  GUIs written using Gtk2Hs use themes to resemble the native look on Windows.
  Gtk is the toolkit used by Gnome, one of the two major GUI toolkits on Linux.
  On Mac OS programs written using Gtk2Hs are run by Apple's X11 server but may
  also be linked against a native Aqua implementation of Gtk.

  You can look forward to using the following improvements in this release:

  XXX

  This release has been tested on Linux and Windows with a variety of
  combinations of Gtk+ and GHC versions.

  Installation
  ------------
  Assuming you have the necessary Gtk+ base libraries already installed, you
  can get the basic set of Haskell bindings with these two commands:

  cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
  cabal install gtk

  Other available packages include gconf, glade, gnomevfs, gstreamer, gtkglext,
  gtksourceview2, soegtk, svgcairo, vte, and webkit. There are longer-winded
  instructions that include pointers on getting the Gtk+ base libraries
  installed on the website [2].

  Features
  --------
  * Automatic memory management (unlike some other C/C++ GUI libraries, Gtk+
    provides proper support for garbage-collected languages)
  * Unicode support
  * High quality vector graphics using Cairo
  * Extensive reference documentation
  * An implementation of the ``Haskell School of Expression'' graphics API

  Community
  ---------
  You can keep up with the latest developments on the mailing lists:
  * gtk2hs-users [3]: discussions about writing code that uses Gtk2Hs
  * gtk2hs-devel [4]: discussions about modifying the Gtk2Hs bindings
  * gtk2hs-commit [5]: a read-only mailing list with announcements of every
    patch to hit the darcs repository

  Check out the latest code via darcs:
